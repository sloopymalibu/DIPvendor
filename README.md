# DIPvendor
A simple database and python script to register vendor IDs.

# A Minimally Viable Vendor Registration System

The JSON file is the master file that keeps track of DIP maker vendor IDs. Please only register what you need.

The simple python script can be called from the terminal.
Call script with three arguments: contact email address, name of company, and, optionally, a preferred 32-bit vendor ID number in hex format. For example:
```
$ python genID.py person@dipmaker.com "DIP Makers Inc." 0x00000001'
```
The script will check if the email is a valid format, but will not attempt any further validation.
If you provide a vendor ID, the script will make sure it is not already taken. If it is, it will offer to randomly generate one for you. 

An example session:
```
$ python genID.py person@dipmaker.com "DIP Makers Inc." 0x009d011a
 :( Your chosen Vendor ID 0x009d011a is already taken.
 > Type "e" to exit or "g" to generate a new ID: g
 + Your new vendor ID is: 0x20bc2e55
 :) vendorDB updated
```

Once the script is updated, create a pull request on this repo so we can officially add the Vendor ID.
